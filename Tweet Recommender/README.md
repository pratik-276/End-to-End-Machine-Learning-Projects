# Introduction

[TweetNiche](https://thawing-garden-45544.herokuapp.com/) is a tool built for Twitter users & content creators looking to better understand the audience in their niche. Newbies to content creation often start out writing on a broad range of topics before finding a dedicated audience for a niche. Along the way, it is important to learn and understand various topics and explore several niche's before landing on one that works.

TweetNiche has two components: a recommender & a tweet analytics tool. 
Often, a user's Twitter feed is filled with content from a wide range of the user's interest and it can be hard to study a niche. TweetNiche recommends tweets which from user specified niche but also factoring in user's own tweets to maintain the relevance to the user.

The user may expect a tweet to perform well however reality may be different. TweetNiche's tweet analytics tool can help study a tweet's performance by showing a user's tweet in relation to other tweets in the Niche that are most similar but more popular than the user's tweet.
